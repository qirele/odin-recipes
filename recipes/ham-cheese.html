          <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
          <li>1 ½ tablespoons poppy seeds</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
          <li>24 mini sandwich rolls</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
            baking dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix together butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce,
            poppy seeds, and dried onion. Separate the tops from bottoms of the
            rolls, and place the bottom pieces into the prepared baking dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layer about half the ham onto the rolls. Arrange the Swiss cheese
            over the ham, and top with remaining ham slices in a layer. Place
            the tops of the rolls onto the sandwiches. Pour the mustard mixture
            evenly over the rolls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned and
            the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Slice into individual rolls
            through the ham and cheese layers to serve.
          </li>
        </ol>
